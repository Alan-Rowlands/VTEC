            <h2>What is VTEC?</h2>
     <p>
         VTEC is a form of bacterium that can cause diarrhoea and also produces a toxin that is able to damage your bowel wall.
         People become ill with the virus within 2 to 4 days of being infected but in other cases it could take much longer.
         It most commonly occurs in the summer and any children under the age of 10 are highly likely to catch it.
     </p>
         
    <h2>How did I get infected?</h2>     
    <p>
        Contact with farm animals who carry the bacteria in their bowels or in their faeces.
        Eating food/ drinks that could be contaminated with even a tiny amount of faeces.
        It can also spread from person to person with contact, most likely happeneing in places like creches, nursing homes and hospitals.
        If you have a well at home as your main water source, the untreated water in the well can also carry the bacteria. 
     </p>
            
           
    <h2>How can it be treated?</h2>
         <p>
             <b>Rehydration!</b><br/> Drinking plenty of fluids is helpful. 
             VTEC is usually uncomplicated and most people recover without any problems.
             Antibiotics don't get rid of the VTEC germ and may increase the risk of getting Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS).
         </p>
         
         <h2>What is  Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS)?</h2>     
         <p>
             HUS is a dangerous <b>life threatening</b> condition, up to 5% of people who develop HUS may die.
             HUS infections are the cause of 5 to 10% of cases, particularly with children under 5 and the elderly.
             With HUS  the red blood cells are destroyed and your kidneys will fail.
             This may happen after a week of bloody diarrhoea.
             The symptoms of HUS are decreased urine being produced, irritability, fatigue and bruising or swelling of the hands and feet.
             You may need to give or blood samples to check if you're developing HUS.<br/>        
            </p>
            
            <h2>Public health actions in VTEC cases</h2>
         <p>
             VTEC is a notifiable infection. It means that your doctor or a laboratory must report any cases of VTEC to the Department of Public Health.
             They assess all cases and if you have a strain which produces the toxins then they need to identify if there has been any spread.
             They do this to prevent any further cases and to protect those who could be at risk of infection.<br/>
            </p>
            
            <br/><p>People who may pose a risk of infection to other people include children under five, healthcare workers, food handlers and some others including older children and adults with disabilites who may not be able to implement good hygiene standards.
             
             In order to be deemed clear of VTEC you need to be able to provide two negative stool smaples taken 24 hours or more hours apart.
             
            It can take from as little as <b>one week to several months</b> in some cases to be clear the infection.If the siutation applies to you, your public health doctor will be able to give you more information.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Gastroenteritis (diarrhoea and/or vomiting)</h2>
            <p>
             
                Anyone who has Gastroenteritis should not attend work, school or pre-school until 48 hours have passed after last vomiting and that diarrhoea has stopped.<br/>
            <br/><b><i>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before: </i></b><br/>
             → Preparing, eating or serving food.<br/>
             → Leaving the house<br/>
             
             <br/><b><i>And after:</i></b><br/>
             → Handling sick persons clothes or bedding<br/>
             → Contact with sick room equipment<br/>
             → Dealing with sick people <br/>
             → Going to the toilet <br/>
             → Changing nappies<br/>
             → Preparing food<br/>
            </p>
            
            <h2>VTEC in Food</h2>
         <p>
             Unpasteurised milk and milk products and minced meat are foods usually involved in VTEC outbreaks.
             E.coli O157 has been found in 10% of milk samples from farm bulk tanks, 2-4% of raw minced beef and in 1.5 - 2% of raw pork and poultry.
             VTEC is killed by heat so it is very important to fully cook foods that could be contaminated.
             Adequate treatment of water supplies and pasteurising milk will also kill the germs.
         </p>
         
         <h2>Cleaning toilets, basins and soiled articles</h2>
         <p>
             Wear rubber gloves and use detergent (Flash or Cif) and water to clean toilet seats, flush handles and hand basin taps at least twice a day.
             Wear rubber gloves and an apron when cleaning up after a patient.
             Empty bed pans into the toilet and then wash them with detergent, rinse and allow them to dry.
             If clothes/bed linen are badly soiled flush as much as possible into the toilet and then put them into the washing machine on a hot wash. 
             After loading the washing machine, wipe down the outside with water and detergent particularly if children are playing nearby.
             When finished, wash and dry your hands.
             
         </p>
         
         <h2>Clearing up diarrhoea and vomit</h2>
         <p>
             Wear rubber gloves and a disposable apron (if available) when cleaning up diarrhoea and vomit.
             Try to keep the area of contamination as small as possible.
             Soak up excess liquid with paper towel/tissues. Use a plastic dustpan to scoop up the mess and flush it down the toilet, wash the area thoroughly with detergent and hot water, rinse the cold water and allow it to dry.
             Throw out disposbale aprons and wash cleaning clothes, gloves and dustpans in detergent and water, rinse and allow them to dry.

            <h2>How do you know you've got it?</h2>
         <p>
             Usually the first symptom is Diarrohea and some other people may also experience vomiting and/or a high temperature.
             The toxin can cause inflammation of the bowel wall and this can lead to severe stomach cramps and bloody diarrhoea.
             This can last on average for 6 days but it can range from 2 to 9 days.
             
             Other people may experience very mild or even no symptoms  at all.
             You would have to give your local doctor a stool sample and have it sent to the hospital lab to check if you've VTEC or not.

             HUS is a medical emergency which requires hospital treatment.
             Transfusions and dialysis may be used to treat low blood count and kidney failure.

                 <h2>Preparing Food</h2>
         <p>
             If you have diarrhoea or vomiting, try not to prepare food for other people as it is very easy to spread infection through soiled hands. 
             Food that is fully cooked and eaten immediately should be safe but beware of making salads if you have Gastroenteritis. 
             Never change a baby where you prepare or eat food also!

          <h2>Farm Visits</h2>
         <p>
             People visiting farms should be made aware of the risks to health from animal contact.<br/>
             Children should always be supervised during farm visits.<br/>
             After visiting a farm or being in contact with farm animals it is important to wash your hands particularly before having anything to eat or drink including ice cream
